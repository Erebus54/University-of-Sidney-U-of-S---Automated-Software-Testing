Instructors: Tara Murphy and Simon Murphy

In this course you will investigate the challenges of working with large datasets and implentation of algorithms at scale: 
* implement a mean and median stacking algorithm that calculates the median and mean stack of a set of FITS radio astronomy images to isolate pulsars
* how to implement algorithms that work at scale 
* how to use databases to manage your data
* how to learn from your data with machine learning tools
